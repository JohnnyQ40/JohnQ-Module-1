# JohnQ-Module-1

For this project we focused on going over written code in order to clean up some redundancy along with improving accessability for a created website. The acceptance criteria called for use of semantic html elements and following logical structures. I began with focusing on the index.html section of the code. The majority of the changes revolved around changing the order of some code and replacing extra '<div>'s with more accurate semantic devices. As for the CSS section of the code changes had to be made in response to the changes made in the html section. Along with that a strong focus was reducing redundancy in code that could be reduced to a single class call opposed to repeating uneeded calls.
